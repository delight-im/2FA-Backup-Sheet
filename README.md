    "backup-sheet-twitter.png"
```

### Security

Do *not* store the resulting backup sheets in the same place as your passwords, if such a place exists. For example, if you use a password manager to store your passwords, do *not* save your recovery codes or backup sheets there. Consider storing the backup sheets only in *printed form*, and put them in a safe place â€“ perhaps even at two separate physical locations.

If you want to include a QR code representing the key URI, which includes the shared secret or seed, you may want to take a screenshot of the QR code shown to you by the service in question. If you save the QR code directly, e.g. in your web browser, a new code (and thus secret) *may* be generated, depending on the service and the software you use. After generating the backup sheet, delete the screenshot that you took.
